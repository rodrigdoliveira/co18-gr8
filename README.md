## GR8 Program Example


    small function g uses small i
    define small function f on small i as
      small n (initially 9)
      if i equals 0 then
        assign 0 to n
      else
        assign i plus use i minus 1 for g to n
      return n
    define small function g on small i as
      small n (initially 9)
      if i equals 0 then
        assign 0 to n
      else
        assign i plus use i minus 1 for f to n
      return n
    define public small function covfefe as
      post use 3 for f
